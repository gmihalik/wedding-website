----------------Wedding Website built as an SPA using AnjularJS-----------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to my wedding website!

This site is built as a single page application (SPA) using the AngularJS 
framework

The SPA is broken into 3 main parts

1) The index.html file
    - This is the main page/template for the SPA
    - All other pages are rendered as divs in this main page

2) The app.js file
    - This is the main javascript file that loads the routes and controllers

3) Pages folder
    - This contains the html files that are loads inside the index.html file
    - each one of these files corresponds to its own route and controller
